# discord-bonk
Pretty simple bot that detects Nitro phising links in Discord and autodeletes them by default. 

Has the option to either report them to a mod channel, kick the author or even keep the original message. Configurable per-guild using slash commands.

It can be self-hosted if you want.

## Acknowledgements
- Discord.js for their easy-to-use library. The entire bot was built in less than half a day.
- `stop-discord-phishing` for their comprehensive list of phising links.
- `makibot` for the original idea behind the bot.
