# discord-bonk
Pretty simple bot that detects Nitro phising links in Discord and autodeletes them by default. 

Has the option to either report them to a mod channel, kick the author or even keep the original message. Configurable per-guild using slash commands.

It can be self-hosted if you want.

## Installation & run
- Clone the repository
- Install the packages with your favorite Node.js package manager
- Edit `config.sample.json` with the appropiate values and rename it to `config.json`
- Run `npm start` (or the equivalent)
- ???
- Bonk
## Acknowledgements
- Discord.js for their easy-to-use library. The entire bot was built in less than half a day.
- `stop-discord-phishing` for their comprehensive list of phising links.
- `makibot` for the original idea behind the bot.
